Memo:
Auto reloading during development with ts-node-dev. It is meant to be used only
with a development environment which takes care of recompilation on every
change, so restarting the application won't be necessary.

Install ts-node-dev to development dependencies:
`npm install --save-dev ts-node-dev`
